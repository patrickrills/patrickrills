### About Me

I’m Patrick Rills, a coder in Boston, MA originally from Baton Rouge, LA. I’ve worked in technology and software for over 20 years in various roles from network administrator to project manager with a focus the past 12+ years in mobile development and UX.

I’m currently the SVP of Product at Lose It!, the premier mobile-based weight loss app which since 2009 has helped over 40 million users lose over 130 million pounds and is consistently a top health and fitness app in Apple's App Store.

In my spare time, I create my own iOS apps under the banner of Big Blue Fly. So far, I've released two apps: Duffy, an elegant steps complication for your Apple Watch (which is also open source), and Squiddle, a fun way to doodle and remind yourself on the go.
