## About Me

I’m **[Patrick Rills](http://www.patrickrills.com/)**, a coder in Boston, MA originally from Baton Rouge, LA. I’ve worked in technology and software for over 20 years in various roles from network administrator to project manager with a focus the past 12+ years in mobile development and UX.

I’m currently the SVP of Product at [Lose It!](https://github.com/loseit), the premier mobile-based weight loss app which since 2009 has helped over 40 million users lose over 130 million pounds and is consistently a top health and fitness app in [Apple's App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lose-it-calorie-counter/id297368629).

In my spare time, I create my own iOS apps under the banner of [Big Blue Fly](http://www.bigbluefly.com). So far, I've released two apps: 
  - **[Duffy](http://www.bigbluefly.com/duffy)**: an elegant steps complication for your Apple Watch, which is [open source](https://www.github.com/patrickrills/duffy/).
  - **[Squiddle](http://www.bigbluefly.com/squiddle)**: a fun way to doodle and remind yourself on the go.
